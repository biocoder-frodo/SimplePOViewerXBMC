This tiny application reads the language files from the XBMC source tree and can show multiple languages side by side.
Specify XBMC_ROOT in your environment or pass the path as the first argument to the executable on the commandline.

Features:
* Load the language data for xbmc-core and an addon (skin-confluence by default)
  at the same time.
* You can configure the application to automatically load a few (or more) languages at startup.
* Filter for strings with C-style placeholders (%).
* Filter for text in all loaded languages. 
* Export your localized text to a tab delimited text file.
* Lookup localization strings by numeric ID.
